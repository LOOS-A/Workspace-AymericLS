                We thank the many readers who have found the (too numerous) errors in
the first edition. We apologize for those and have done our best to avoid errors
in this new edition.We thank Mark Segal, Bala Rajaratnam, and Larry
Wasserman for comments on some of the new chapters, and many Stanford
graduate and post-doctoral students who offered comments, in particular
Mohammed AlQuraishi, John Boik, Holger Hoefling, Arian Maleki, Donal
McMahon, Saharon Rosset, Babak Shababa, Daniela Witten, Ji Zhu and
Hui Zou.We thank John Kimmel for his patience in guiding us through this
new edition. RT dedicates this edition to the memory of Anna McPhee.
The field of Statistics is constantly challenged by the problems that science
and industry brings to its door. In the early days, these problems often came
from agricultural and industrial experiments and were relatively small in
scope. With the advent of computers and the information age, statistical
problems have exploded both in size and complexity. Challenges in the
areas of data storage, organization and searching have led to the new field
of “data mining”; statistical and computational problems in biology and
medicine have created “bioinformatics.” Vast amounts of data are being
generated in many fields, and the statistician’s job is to make sense of it
all: to extract important patterns and trends, and understand “what the
data says.” We call this learning from data.

                We would like to acknowledge the contribution of many people to the
conception and completion of this book. David Andrews, Leo Breiman,
Andreas Buja, John Chambers, Bradley Efron, Geoffrey Hinton, Werner
Stuetzle, and John Tukey have greatly influenced our careers. Balasubramanian
Narasimhan gave us advice and help on many computational
problems, and maintained an excellent computing environment. Shin-Ho
Bang helped in the production of a number of the figures. Lee Wilkinson
gave valuable tips on color production. Ilana Belitskaya, Eva Cantoni, Maya
Gupta, Michael Jordan, Shanti Gopatam, Radford Neal, Jorge Picazo, Bogdan
Popescu, Olivier Renaud, Saharon Rosset, John Storey, Ji Zhu, Mu
Zhu, two reviewers and many students read parts of the manuscript and
offered helpful suggestions. John Kimmel was supportive, patient and helpful
at every phase; MaryAnn Brickner and Frank Ganz headed a superb
production team at Springer. Trevor Hastie would like to thank the statistics
department at the University of Cape Town for their hospitality during
the final stages of this book. We gratefully acknowledge NSF and NIH for
their support of this work. Finally, we would like to thank our families and
our parents for their love and support.
This book is designed for researchers and students in a broad variety of
fields: statistics, artificial intelligence, engineering, finance and others. We
expect that the reader will have had at least one elementary course in
statistics, covering basic topics including linear regression.
We have not attempted to write a comprehensive catalog of learning
methods, but rather to describe some of the most important techniques.
Equally notable, we describe the underlying concepts and considerations
by which a researcher can judge a learning method. We have tried to write
this book in an intuitive fashion, emphasizing concepts rather than mathematical
details.
As statisticians, our exposition will naturally reflect our backgrounds and
areas of expertise. However in the past eight years we have been attending
conferences in neural networks, data mining and machine learning, and our
thinking has been heavily influenced by these exciting fields. This influence
is evident in our current research, and in this book.
